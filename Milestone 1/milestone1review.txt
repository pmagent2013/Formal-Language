Analysis

- Good state descriptions
- Good and efficient construction of the DFA

Completeness 
- Test cases are difficult and interesting
- Includes both correct and incorrect statements
- Includes both correct and incorrect asignments
- Includes both correct and incorrect identifiers

Correctness
- DFA diagram is incorrect:
  > what is q29? it does not seem to lead anywhere, it seems like an error
  > state, but it is not
- Tables are incorrect
  > description of q29 does not match DFA
- Test cases are correct
